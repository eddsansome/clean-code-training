## Exercise #1: Extract Local Variables 
An explaining variable is a variable whose name describes the purpose of the expression you're assigning to it. It's used to help break down longer, more complex expressions, making the final expression more manageable and easier to understand.

## Exercise #1: Extract Private Methods
Explanation: TODO
After extracting the functionality into private methods we have short, self-explained public methods, so that if developers need more information about inner behaviour, they could dive into the private section.
Another benefit of private methods against just local methods is that private methods are more flexible and more available for changes and even for further refactoring.
